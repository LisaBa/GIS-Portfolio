# GIS-Portfolio

This is a short introduction into my work in the world of GIS and Remote Sensing.

# About me

I'm Lisa, 30 years old and after doing my Bachelors in Environmental Sciences at the Leuphana University I went and did my Masters at Trier University in Geoinformatics. Now I'm living in Munich and work as a GIS-Expert and GIS-App-Developer at a Environmental Consulting company. My focus is on GIS analysis, data transformation and 3D visualization.
